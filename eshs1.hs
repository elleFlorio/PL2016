-- It is important here to consider the difference between a concrete type 
-- (examples include Int, [Char] and Maybe Bool) which is a type that can be 
-- assigned to a value in your program, and a type constructor function which 
-- you need to feed a type to be able to be assigned to a value. 
-- A value can never be of type "list", because it needs to be a "list of something". 
-- In the same spirit, a value can never be of type "binary tree", because it needs 
-- to be a "binary tree storing something".
